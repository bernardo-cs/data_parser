listening to carry you home
sometimes you need to be alone  in order to find out who you really are and what you really want 
some people can t sleep because they have insomnia  i can t sleep because i have internet connection  what about you 
 move on  there s no point of living in the past  just because it s hard  doesn t mean it s impossible
there is a story behind every person  there s a reason why they re the way they are   think about that before you judge someone


to make your life simpler and easier  stop frustrating yourself from things that don t really exist 

when you forgive  stop bringing it up  no one wants to be around someone who constantly makes them feel guilty 
i love sleep  you forget about pain  problems  stress  everything for a while         zzz
we don t need to rush  if somethings bound to happen  it will happen  in the right time  with the right person and for the best reason 
past is past  if u want happiness  don t walk together with your past  past is just a lesson  you can look back  but never bring it back 

mile toh hazar the zindagi mein par woh sabse alag tha jo kismat mein nahi tha  ouze 
past is past  if u want happiness  don t walk together with your past  past is just a lesson  you can look back  but never bring it back

nothing deserves any more attention than one single tear 
agar koi haath mere haath me ho to vo hath tumara ho  agar hum jiye kisi ke saath to vo saath tumara ho  mera    
the prettiest smiles hide the deepest secrets  the prettiest eyes have cried the most tears  and the kindest hearts have felt the most pain 
the  happiest people on the planet are the ones who have deep  meaningful relationships  
why look to others for answers that are in your own heart 
i love seeing people walking by with little smiles on their face because something small happened that made them happy 
 smile  let everyone know that today you re a lot stronger than you were yesterday 
 no matter how  busy  a person s day may be  if they  really care   they ll always find time for you
stay strong  even when it feels like everything is falling apart

when i go to bed  half the time i m not really sleeping  i m usually lying there  making up scenarios in my head 
 happiness can be found even in the darkest of times  if one only remembers to turn on the light 
sometimes in order to appreciate your future  you must remember the past  v
you should never apologize for saying what you feel  that s like saying sorry for being real

the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past  you can t go forward in life until u let go of ur past failures  amp  heartaches 
                                                                                        
you can t always be nice  that s how people take advantage of you  sometimes you have to set boundaries 
need to stop imagining scenarios in my head that have a     chance of actually happening it s becoming a problem

one of the hardest thing in life is letting go of something that you thought was real 
no matter how carefully you choose your words  they ll always end up being twisted by others

within   minutes of waking up      of your dream is forgotten and within    minutes      of your dream will be gone

yeah if you give a little love  you can get a little love of your own don t break his heart well if you are  what    
never abandon your dreams just because someone living their nightmare told you to 
appreciate those who love you  help those who need you  forgive those who hurt you  forget those who leave you 
before you give up  think about why you held on for so long

i think the only reason people hold onto memories so tight is because memories are the only things that dont change when everybody else does
sometimes  it s better if you know nothing and be happy than you knoweverything then you feel insecure about everything

never give up on something  you need to show yourself you re strong enough 
  most painful things  trying to hide what you really feel  loving someone who loves another  and taking risk to fall in love again
