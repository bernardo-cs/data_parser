democracy is a  one hat fits all  approach  it s an ideal you should evolve to  never the starting point 
democracy is a cute idea  but the you look at china  and the progress they ve made  and you realize democracy really isn t the solution

this bayern press is working  and it s killing us 
a red for dante in this half would set the game up nicely  only fair 
ffs let s not get another red in this game  arteta  amp  poldi not the most safest players to have on yellows 
bayern properly switched on today  no more catching them by surprise  no complacency on their part 
 afridi said that bus owners pay taxes to the government and provide a safe transport facility to the public    karachi public transport 
a starker example  friend s mentality switch  driving back home from the airport  jumping traffic lights   i never stop here    hopeless
sure not all who move don t move to save their lives  but security concerns have to be top    if not top reason for a majority 
you can fault them  i don t  for not staying and making a diff  but now it s become a move to pretty much save your life  can t fault that 
also i think those who moved out in the   s   s were mainly for better opportunities  lifestyles  amp  frustrating systems here etc 
pakistani taxi drivers stopping at lights  giving way to other cars  refusing to sit more than   passengers etc  here they become cunts 
but then you go to dubai  and you see a similar lifestyle replicated  what pinches more is the  desis  being model citizens there 
go to the western countries  and as much as you admire their system and infrastructure  you assume it can t be done here  third world  amp  all 
few thoughts on dubai  been there before for a couple of days  but that was hotels only  this time got a different persp  staying at a home
